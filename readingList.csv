https://ryanholiday.net/this-is-the-word-im-trying-to-live-by-this-year/,This is the Word I'm Trying to Live By This Year - RyanHoliday.net,"The past year has been all about LESS for me. At the end of 2022, actually as part of The Daily Stoic New Year New You Challenge (‚Äãnew one starting on Jan 1 if you want to join us‚Äã), my wife and I picked a word we were going to use as our lodestar for the year. We picked ‚Äòless‚Äô because we felt like we were too busy, too overwhelmed, too stressed, too frustrated. I was just exhausted as December ended and I felt like my health, my family, and my quality of life could not face another year of the same. So as I wrote here, ‚Äãin an article‚Äã, my goal was: Less. Less commitments. Less drama. Less busyness. Less screen time. Just less. Part of the reason I want less is so I have room for more. More stillness. More presence. Looking back, I think we did a pretty good job. I was strict about passing on stuff I didn‚Äôt want to do. I asked my assistant not to schedule appointments or interviews or calls on Fridays. I pushed ‚Äãmy book‚Äã back a year‚Äîwhich required some serious negotiations with my publisher and facing a lot of ideas in myself about what it meant to not be so busy and always being doing, doing, doing. What did this ‚Äòless‚Äô translate to? Certainly not a lot of ‚Äònothing,‚Äô which is what I think we suspect we‚Äôll turn into if we start saying that powerful word ‚Äòno‚Äô or if we start slowing down. Instead, what happened is that I did a lot more. I did more school lunches and school drop offs. We went on more trips together. My wife and I hung out more. I spent more time on the book that I delayed, and now it‚Äôs much, much better. Now, staring down the barrel of a new year, I intend to continue this trend of less (to get the double benefit, as Marcus Aurelius writes in ‚ÄãMeditations‚Äã, of doing the essential things better). But I also wanted to pick a new word to aim at. This year, the word for me is: Systems. In ‚ÄãEgo Is The Enemy‚Äã, I tell the story of the day of Dwight D. Eisenhower‚Äôs inauguration. In 1953, Eisenhower was entering the White House as the newly inaugurated president, having just returned from his parade. As he walked into the Executive Mansion, his chief usher handed Eisenhower two letters marked ‚ÄúConfidential and Secret‚Äù that had been sent to him earlier in the day. ‚ÄúNever bring me a sealed envelope,‚Äù Eisenhower said firmly. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I have a staff for.‚Äù He wasn‚Äôt a snob nor was he being lazy. Eisenhower was a man who lived by systems. He saw the need for an efficient, orderly executive branch, mirroring the way his military units had been. His focus was on delegating, trusting his staff, and maintaining order. As his chief of staff later put it, ‚ÄúThe president does the most important things. I do the next most important things.‚Äù A system is a way to do more by doing less. By setting up processes‚Äîwhich can be work up front‚Äîyou find efficiencies. By setting up clear and defined roles, you can effectively delegate. By setting up standards and expectations, you can not only hold people accountable, but you can measure and optimize those processes to be even more efficient. It‚Äôs a positive feedback loop. What‚Äôs an example of a good system? I‚Äôve talked about ‚Äãmy notecard system‚Äã before, that‚Äôs a system by which I research and write my books. I don‚Äôt just wing it. It‚Äôs a process by which I‚Äîand other writers‚Äîtry to take an enormous and overwhelming task and try to make it manageable. As Robert Greene, who taught me the notecard system, says, ‚ÄúA lot of books fail because the writer loses control of the research. You are either a master of the material or it‚Äôs the master of you.‚Äù Sometimes a system is something like that‚Äîa process. Other times, systems are a person or a group of people, like Eisenhower was referring to with his staff. ‚ÄúA system,‚Äù as Donella Meadows defines it in ‚ÄãThinking in Systems‚Äã, ‚Äúis a set of related components that work together in a particular environment to perform whatever functions are required to achieve the system‚Äôs objective.‚Äù A to do list is a system. A chain of command is a system. A rule that says ‚ÄúI never say ‚Äòyes‚Äô in the room‚Äù is a system for making better decisions. In fact, there was another insight from Eisenhower called the Eisenhower Decision Matrix that he would use to prioritize stuff. To separate and distinguish immediate tasks from important ones, Eisenhower would group tasks into a 2√ó2 matrix: urgent and important (quadrant I), important but not urgent (quadrant II), urgent but not important (quadrant III), and not important and not urgent (quadrant IV). It is a system for channeling focus onto tasks that are truly important and contribute to your long-term goals, rather than just reacting to what seems urgent at the moment. Contrasting with Eisenhower, in ‚ÄãEgo Is The Enemy‚Äã, I also tell the story of John DeLorean, whose management style was once described as ‚Äúchasing colored balloons.‚Äù Coming out of the bureaucratic management style of General Motors, DeLorean tried to make himself the center of everything. The result was chaos‚Äîchaos that both fueled his ego (somebody always needed him) and destroyed what was actually a pretty visionary car company. Few of us are that bad, but we could all do better with better systems. Because it‚Äôs really easy, when you don‚Äôt have a system, to get caught up just winging it‚Äìhandling whatever is urgent, whatever someone has randomly brought you, or whatever pops up in your email or whatever you feel like doing in the moment. One of the reasons I am deciding to focus on systems this year is that it‚Äôs unavoidable. For a long time, I kept my life and my business deliberately very small.
