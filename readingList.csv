https://ryanholiday.net/this-is-the-word-im-trying-to-live-by-this-year/,This is the Word I'm Trying to Live By This Year - RyanHoliday.net,"The past year has been all about LESS for me. At the end of 2022, actually as part of The Daily Stoic New Year New You Challenge (‚Äãnew one starting on Jan 1 if you want to join us‚Äã), my wife and I picked a word we were going to use as our lodestar for the year. We picked ‚Äòless‚Äô because we felt like we were too busy, too overwhelmed, too stressed, too frustrated. I was just exhausted as December ended and I felt like my health, my family, and my quality of life could not face another year of the same. So as I wrote here, ‚Äãin an article‚Äã, my goal was: Less. Less commitments. Less drama. Less busyness. Less screen time. Just less. Part of the reason I want less is so I have room for more. More stillness. More presence. Looking back, I think we did a pretty good job. I was strict about passing on stuff I didn‚Äôt want to do. I asked my assistant not to schedule appointments or interviews or calls on Fridays. I pushed ‚Äãmy book‚Äã back a year‚Äîwhich required some serious negotiations with my publisher and facing a lot of ideas in myself about what it meant to not be so busy and always being doing, doing, doing. What did this ‚Äòless‚Äô translate to? Certainly not a lot of ‚Äònothing,‚Äô which is what I think we suspect we‚Äôll turn into if we start saying that powerful word ‚Äòno‚Äô or if we start slowing down. Instead, what happened is that I did a lot more. I did more school lunches and school drop offs. We went on more trips together. My wife and I hung out more. I spent more time on the book that I delayed, and now it‚Äôs much, much better. Now, staring down the barrel of a new year, I intend to continue this trend of less (to get the double benefit, as Marcus Aurelius writes in ‚ÄãMeditations‚Äã, of doing the essential things better). But I also wanted to pick a new word to aim at. This year, the word for me is: Systems. In ‚ÄãEgo Is The Enemy‚Äã, I tell the story of the day of Dwight D. Eisenhower‚Äôs inauguration. In 1953, Eisenhower was entering the White House as the newly inaugurated president, having just returned from his parade. As he walked into the Executive Mansion, his chief usher handed Eisenhower two letters marked ‚ÄúConfidential and Secret‚Äù that had been sent to him earlier in the day. ‚ÄúNever bring me a sealed envelope,‚Äù Eisenhower said firmly. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I have a staff for.‚Äù He wasn‚Äôt a snob nor was he being lazy. Eisenhower was a man who lived by systems. He saw the need for an efficient, orderly executive branch, mirroring the way his military units had been. His focus was on delegating, trusting his staff, and maintaining order. As his chief of staff later put it, ‚ÄúThe president does the most important things. I do the next most important things.‚Äù A system is a way to do more by doing less. By setting up processes‚Äîwhich can be work up front‚Äîyou find efficiencies. By setting up clear and defined roles, you can effectively delegate. By setting up standards and expectations, you can not only hold people accountable, but you can measure and optimize those processes to be even more efficient. It‚Äôs a positive feedback loop. What‚Äôs an example of a good system? I‚Äôve talked about ‚Äãmy notecard system‚Äã before, that‚Äôs a system by which I research and write my books. I don‚Äôt just wing it. It‚Äôs a process by which I‚Äîand other writers‚Äîtry to take an enormous and overwhelming task and try to make it manageable. As Robert Greene, who taught me the notecard system, says, ‚ÄúA lot of books fail because the writer loses control of the research. You are either a master of the material or it‚Äôs the master of you.‚Äù Sometimes a system is something like that‚Äîa process. Other times, systems are a person or a group of people, like Eisenhower was referring to with his staff. ‚ÄúA system,‚Äù as Donella Meadows defines it in ‚ÄãThinking in Systems‚Äã, ‚Äúis a set of related components that work together in a particular environment to perform whatever functions are required to achieve the system‚Äôs objective.‚Äù A to do list is a system. A chain of command is a system. A rule that says ‚ÄúI never say ‚Äòyes‚Äô in the room‚Äù is a system for making better decisions. In fact, there was another insight from Eisenhower called the Eisenhower Decision Matrix that he would use to prioritize stuff. To separate and distinguish immediate tasks from important ones, Eisenhower would group tasks into a 2√ó2 matrix: urgent and important (quadrant I), important but not urgent (quadrant II), urgent but not important (quadrant III), and not important and not urgent (quadrant IV). It is a system for channeling focus onto tasks that are truly important and contribute to your long-term goals, rather than just reacting to what seems urgent at the moment. Contrasting with Eisenhower, in ‚ÄãEgo Is The Enemy‚Äã, I also tell the story of John DeLorean, whose management style was once described as ‚Äúchasing colored balloons.‚Äù Coming out of the bureaucratic management style of General Motors, DeLorean tried to make himself the center of everything. The result was chaos‚Äîchaos that both fueled his ego (somebody always needed him) and destroyed what was actually a pretty visionary car company. Few of us are that bad, but we could all do better with better systems. Because it‚Äôs really easy, when you don‚Äôt have a system, to get caught up just winging it‚Äìhandling whatever is urgent, whatever someone has randomly brought you, or whatever pops up in your email or whatever you feel like doing in the moment. One of the reasons I am deciding to focus on systems this year is that it‚Äôs unavoidable. For a long time, I kept my life and my business deliberately very small.

The authors have identified a series of interventions that anyone can use: The helpful workaround is useful when there is low psychological safety on the team or with the person conducting the meeting. Here, you don‚Äôt explicitly name the thing that bothers you, but you ask a question that can help resolve the feelings of frustration you may be experiencing in the meeting. The solution-centric proposal works when there is moderate psychological safety. Here, you are to point to the problem area by asking a question that demonstrates how resolving the issue will increase the effectiveness of the meeting. The constructive confrontation is for high psychological safety situations. With this approach, you decide to explicitly name the problem and give feedback to forge a productive solution.",https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2024/03/A_Mar24_25_Meeting-boss_1043627262.jpg,2024-04-27T15:18:07.51184132Z,
https://ryanholiday.net/37-pieces-of-career-advice-i-wish-id-known-earlier/?amp=1,37 Pieces of Career Advice I Wish I‚Äôd Known Earlier - RyanHoliday.net,"From my first desk job working at my college newspaper. My first job was working at a small deli and grocery store in Lake Tahoe when I was 15. It was a job that came full circle some twenty years later when my wife and I bought a place called ‚ÄãTracy‚Äôs Drive-In Grocery‚Äã in 2021, a little place that‚Äôs been in business since 1940. I‚Äôve had my fair share of gigs in between. I worked in fast food. I was the director of marketing for a publicly traded company. I‚Äôve been a lifeguard. I dropped out of college to be a research assistant to an author. I worked a desk at a talent agency in Beverly Hills. I‚Äôve started multiple businesses. I‚Äôve freelanced. I‚Äôve been lucky enough to speak and consult with multi-billion dollar companies and Super Bowl winning sports franchises, family offices and law firms. I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôve done it all because that‚Äôs one thing you learn‚Äìhow much you have left to learn‚Äìbut I have done a lot. I‚Äôve had to think a lot about how to be a good employee as well as how to be a good boss. I‚Äôve seen what makes good companies succeed and bad companies fail. I‚Äôve seen how people get ahead‚Ä¶and how people get stuff. I‚Äôve also written a lot about this over the years, as I was figuring it out. In fact, many times I had to talk to bosses about this ‚Äúlittle thing I do on the side‚Äù which was writing until eventually, the business stuff itself because of the stuff I do on the side. And now I have to have the conversation the other way with the people who work for me at ‚ÄãDaily Stoic‚Äã or ‚ÄãBrass Check‚Äã or at ‚ÄãThe Painted Porch‚Äã or at ‚ÄãTracy‚Äôs‚Äã: Ok, but what do you really want to do and how can I help you get there? Anyway, this post is about that. The best of those lessons‚Äîthings I wish I‚Äôd been told when I was just starting and things I still tell myself. Some of them might be exactly what you need to hear right now. Some might not apply to you yet, or ever. That‚Äôs okay. Whether you‚Äôre just starting out, looking to make a big change, or aiming to reach new heights in your current role, I hope you‚Äôll find something here that helps you navigate your own unique path. Be quiet, work hard, and stay healthy. It‚Äôs not ambition or skill that is going to set you apart but sanity. I remember once I called Dov Charney, founder of American Apparel, about some little success I‚Äôd had on some project. He was very busy and frustrated that I‚Äôd interrupted, but politely, he said, ‚ÄúRyan, you are calling me to tell me that you did your job.‚Äù I thought of that conversation when I saw that famous scene in Mad Men where Peggy complains that Don never says thank you. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what the money is for!‚Äù he tells her. The thing that‚Äôs wrong about imposter syndrome is that for the most part no one is thinking about you at all. They‚Äôre too busy with their own doubts and their own work. When I was starting out as an assistant in Hollywood, someone told me that the best thing I could do was make my boss look good. Don‚Äôt worry about credit, they said. Forget credit so hard that you‚Äôre glad when other people get it instead of you. It ended up being pretty decent advice, but it was nowhere near the right wording. I think a better way to express it would be: ‚ÄãFind canvases for other people to paint on‚Äã. Come up with ideas to hand over to your boss. Find people, thinkers, up and comers to introduce them to. Cross wires to create new sparks. Find what nobody else wants to do and do it. Find inefficiency and waste and redundancies. Identify leaks and patches to free up resources for new areas. Produce more than everyone else and give your ideas away. The person who clears the path ultimately controls its direction, just as the canvas shapes the painting. Very rarely have I ever let anyone go because they did not have the skills to do their job. It‚Äôs almost always their unwillingness to learn those skills or their inability to take feedback. When I was 20 years old, I was working at this talent agency in Hollywood, and I got invited to this important meeting. As they were talking about stuff, I interjected and said something. My mentor took me aside after and he said, why did you say that? Did you think it actually needed to be said or did you just feel like you wanted to have something to say? I think about that all the time. It‚Äôs in ‚ÄãThe 48 Laws of Power‚Äã ‚Äî Always say less than necessary. Saying less than necessary, not interjecting at every chance we get‚Äîthis is actually the mark not just of a self-disciplined person, but also a very smart and wise person. The boss/mentor/biz can‚Äôt want you to succeed more than you want it. You have to be the driver of your own life/career/advancement. I was working full time at American Apparel but planning my next move, saving my money and thinking about writing a book. Over lunch one day, Robert Greene told me, Ryan, while people wait for the right moment, ‚Äãthere are two types of time‚Äã: Dead time‚Äîwhere they are passive and biding and Alive time‚Äîwhere they are learning and acting and getting the most out of every second. Which will this be for you? When you‚Äôre lacking motivation, remind yourself: discipline now, freedom later. The labor will pass, and the rewards will last. When I first moved to Austin in 2013, I went out to lunch‚Äîfittingly‚Äîwith a writer named Austin Kleon. I was a longtime fan of his book ‚ÄãSteal Like an Artist‚Äã (his book ‚ÄãKeep Going‚Äã is another favorite).
