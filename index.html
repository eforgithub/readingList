But unlike lawyers, doctors, and psychologists, business professionals are not formally trained on what kinds of questions to ask when approaching a problem. They must learn as they go. In their research and consulting, the authors have seen that certain kinds of questions have gained resonance across the business world. In a three-year project they asked executives to brainstorm about the decisions they’ve faced and the kinds of inquiry they’ve pursued. In this article they share what they’ve learned and offer a practical framework for the five types of questions to ask during strategic decision-making: investigative, speculative, productive, interpretive, and subjective. By attending to each, leaders and teams can become more likely to cover all the areas that need to be explored, and they’ll surface information and options they might otherwise have missed.</span></li><li><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/technologys-generational-moment-with-generative-ai-a-cio-and-cto-guide">A CIO and CTO technology guide to generative AI | McKinsey</a> - 2024-09-08<span class="secondary"> - Nine actions CIOs and CTOs can take to reimagine business and technology with generative AI.</span></li><li><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-top-trends-in-tech">McKinsey technology trends outlook 2024 | McKinsey</a> - 2024-09-07<span class="secondary"> - Which new technology will have the most impact in 2024 and beyond?

But what if you feel like you’re not equipped to take on a new and different leadership style — let alone more than one? In this article, the author outlines the six leadership styles Daniel Goleman first introduced in his 2000 HBR article, “Leadership That Gets Results,” and explains when to use each one. The good news is that personality is not destiny. Even if you’re naturally introverted or you tend to be driven by data and analysis rather than emotion, you can still learn how to adapt different leadership styles to organize, motivate, and direct your team.</span></li></ul><h3 id="august-2024">August 2024</h3><ul><li><a href="https://randsinrepose.com/archives/one-thing/">One Thing – Rands in Repose</a> - 2024-08-31<span class="secondary"> - At this moment, at the beginning of the year, I have eight active big rock projects.

My first job was working at a small deli and grocery store in Lake Tahoe when I was 15. It was a job that came full circle some twenty years later when my wife and I bought a place called ​Tracy’s Drive-In Grocery​ in 2021, a little place that’s been in business since 1940. I’ve had my fair share of gigs in between. I worked in fast food. I was the director of marketing for a publicly traded company. I’ve been a lifeguard. I dropped out of college to be a research assistant to an author. I worked a desk at a talent agency in Beverly Hills. I’ve started multiple businesses. I’ve freelanced. I’ve been lucky enough to speak and consult with multi-billion dollar companies and Super Bowl winning sports franchises, family offices and law firms. I wouldn’t say I’ve done it all because that’s one thing you learn–how much you have left to learn–but I have done a lot. I’ve had to think a lot about how to be a good employee as well as how to be a good boss. I’ve seen what makes good companies succeed and bad companies fail. I’ve seen how people get ahead…and how people get stuff. I’ve also written a lot about this over the years, as I was figuring it out. In fact, many times I had to talk to bosses about this “little thing I do on the side” which was writing until eventually, the business stuff itself because of the stuff I do on the side. And now I have to have the conversation the other way with the people who work for me at ​Daily Stoic​ or ​Brass Check​ or at ​The Painted Porch​ or at ​Tracy’s​: Ok, but what do you really want to do and how can I help you get there? Anyway, this post is about that. The best of those lessons—things I wish I’d been told when I was just starting and things I still tell myself. Some of them might be exactly what you need to hear right now. Some might not apply to you yet, or ever. That’s okay. Whether you’re just starting out, looking to make a big change, or aiming to reach new heights in your current role, I hope you’ll find something here that helps you navigate your own unique path. Be quiet, work hard, and stay healthy. It’s not ambition or skill that is going to set you apart but sanity. I remember once I called Dov Charney, founder of American Apparel, about some little success I’d had on some project. He was very busy and frustrated that I’d interrupted, but politely, he said, “Ryan, you are calling me to tell me that you did your job.” I thought of that conversation when I saw that famous scene in Mad Men where Peggy complains that Don never says thank you. “That’s what the money is for!” he tells her. The thing that’s wrong about imposter syndrome is that for the most part no one is thinking about you at all. They’re too busy with their own doubts and their own work. When I was starting out as an assistant in Hollywood, someone told me that the best thing I could do was make my boss look good. Don’t worry about credit, they said. Forget credit so hard that you’re glad when other people get it instead of you. It ended up being pretty decent advice, but it was nowhere near the right wording. I think a better way to express it would be: ​Find canvases for other people to paint on​. Come up with ideas to hand over to your boss. Find people, thinkers, up and comers to introduce them to. Cross wires to create new sparks. Find what nobody else wants to do and do it. Find inefficiency and waste and redundancies. Identify leaks and patches to free up resources for new areas. Produce more than everyone else and give your ideas away. The person who clears the path ultimately controls its direction, just as the canvas shapes the painting. Very rarely have I ever let anyone go because they did not have the skills to do their job. It’s almost always their unwillingness to learn those skills or their inability to take feedback. When I was 20 years old, I was working at this talent agency in Hollywood, and I got invited to this important meeting. As they were talking about stuff, I interjected and said something. My mentor took me aside after and he said, why did you say that? Did you think it actually needed to be said or did you just feel like you wanted to have something to say? I think about that all the time. It’s in ​The 48 Laws of Power​ — Always say less than necessary. Saying less than necessary, not interjecting at every chance we get—this is actually the mark not just of a self-disciplined person, but also a very smart and wise person. The boss/mentor/biz can’t want you to succeed more than you want it. You have to be the driver of your own life/career/advancement. I was working full time at American Apparel but planning my next move, saving my money and thinking about writing a book. Over lunch one day, Robert Greene told me, Ryan, while people wait for the right moment, ​there are two types of time​: Dead time—where they are passive and biding and Alive time—where they are learning and acting and getting the most out of every second. Which will this be for you? When you’re lacking motivation, remind yourself: discipline now, freedom later. The labor will pass, and the rewards will last. When I first moved to Austin in 2013, I went out to lunch—fittingly—with a writer named Austin Kleon. I was a longtime fan of his book ​Steal Like an Artist​ (his book ​Keep Going​ is another favorite). After we ate, [...]</span></li><li><a href="https://hbr.org/2024/03/how-to-improve-a-meeting-when-youre-not-in-charge">How to Improve a Meeting (When You’re Not in Charge)</a> - 2024-04-27<span class="secondary"> - Research shows that many employees find meetings ineffective, inefficient, or unproductive, but unless you work in a psychologically safe environment, where candor is encouraged, you’re unlikely to raise your hand and speak up about what’s wrong — especially if you’re not the person running the meeting. The authors have identified a series of interventions that anyone can use: The helpful workaround is useful when there is low psychological safety on the team or with the person conducting the meeting. Here, you don’t explicitly name the thing that bothers you, but you ask a question that can help resolve the feelings of frustration you may be experiencing in the meeting. The solution-centric proposal works when there is moderate psychological safety. Here, you are to point to the problem area by asking a question that demonstrates how resolving the issue will increase the effectiveness of the meeting. The constructive confrontation is for high psychological safety situations. With this approach, you decide to explicitly name the problem and give feedback to forge a productive solution.</span></li><li><a href="https://bigthink.com/business/the-reitoff-principle-why-you-should-add-nothing-to-your-work-life-schedule/">Why you should add “nothing” to your work-life schedule - Big Think</a> - 2024-04-10 - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39800732" rel="noopener"><img src="img/y18.svg" height="14em" title="View on Hacker News" alt="Hacker News logo"></a><span class="secondary"> - The Reitoff principle gives us permission to write off a day and intentionally step away from achieving anything.</span></li><li><a href="https://huyenchip.com/2024/03/14/ai-oss.html">What I learned from looking at 900 most popular open source AI tools</a> - 2024-04-04 - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39709912" rel="noopener"><img src="img/y18.svg" height="14em" title="View on Hacker News" alt="Hacker News logo"></a><span class="secondary"> - [Hacker News discussion, LinkedIn discussion, Twitter thread]</span></li></ul><h3 id="march-2024">March 2024</h3><ul><li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/visualize-your-rag-data-evaluate-your-retrieval-augmented-generation-system-with-ragas-fc2486308557">Visualize your RAG Data — Evaluate your Retrieval-Augmented Generation System with Ragas | by Markus Stoll | Mar, 2024 | Towards Data Science</a> - 2024-03-22<span class="secondary"> - How to use UMAP dimensionality reduction for Embeddings to show multiple evaluation Questions and their relationships to source documents…</span></li><li><a href="https://medium.com/towards-data-science/visualize-your-rag-data-evaluate-your-retrieval-augmented-generation-system-with-ragas-fc2486308557">Visualize your RAG Data — Evaluate your Retrieval-Augmented Generation System with Ragas | by Markus Stoll | Mar, 2024 | Towards Data Science</a> - 2024-03-22<span class="secondary"> - How to use UMAP dimensionality reduction for Embeddings to show multiple evaluation Questions and their relationships to source documents…</span></li><li><a href="https://thegrowtheq.com/in-defense-of-performance-a-manifesto-2/">In Defense of Performance: A Manifesto – The Growth Equation</a> - 2024-03-19<span class="secondary"> - When we started writing about performance nearly a decade ago, there was much to be said and done.

Elle est ancienne et coïncide avec l’apparition des systèmes informatisés de gestion documentaire. Au cours des vingt dernières années, les technologies du web - moteurs de recherche, plateformes collaboratives, web sémantique, intelligence artificielle etc. – ont régulièrement remis en question les approches et les techniques de KM et redistribué les cartes entre les différents acteurs de l’offre. Ainsi, le KM est passé par des hauts et des bas.

Individuals can use a similar process to figure out how to live a meaningful life. It starts with defining what makes a great life for you and then outlining your purpose and vision. You must also look at your current “portfolio” — the areas in which you spend your time and energy — to see if you’re investing the best of yourself in the activities most important to you. You should consider what research says about how people tend to find meaning and joy in life. Finally, you’ll want to identify areas where you need to make changes, and then ensure you follow through with objectives and key results. This program, Strategize Your Life, has been tested with more than 500 people around the world. With a few hours of work, you can develop a personal life strategy and summarize it on a single page.</span></li><li><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/solving-reasoning-problems-with-llms-in-2023-6643bdfd606d">Solving Reasoning Problems with LLMs in 2023 | by Zhaocheng Zhu | Jan, 2024 | Towards Data Science</a> - 2024-02-01<span class="secondary"> - It’s the beginning of 2024 and ChatGPT just celebrated its one-year birthday.

But empathy can be emotionally and physically exhausting for managers. “I feel like I’m never enough,” one Fortune 100 executive recently said, “even in my empathy for my people. Anything going wrong with them means I’ve failed.” Not surprisingly, some managers believe they must make a choice: be empathic and sacrifice their personal well-being for the good of others, or back away and preserve their own emotional health. Fortunately, according to the author, a Stanford psychologist and neuroscientist, this dilemma is more apparent than real. He writes that managers can employ three strategies to lead empathically while maintaining their equilibrium. In this article he describes the strategies and presents a blueprint for the practice of what he calls sustainable empathy.</span></li><li><a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/7/19/23799255/head-of-ai-leadership-jobs">AI jobs: No one knows what a head of AI does, but it’s the hottest new job - Vox</a> - 2024-01-23<span class="secondary"> - America’s biggest companies are hiring AI leadership as fast as they can.</span></li><li><a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2023/extracting-skills-from-content-to-fuel-the-linkedin-skills-graph">Extracting skills from content to fuel the LinkedIn Skills Graph | LinkedIn Engineering</a> - 2024-01-22<span class="secondary"> - Co-authors: Sofus Macskassy, Lu Sun, Di Zhou, Rui Kou and Zhuliu Li</span></li><li><a href="https://linkeddataorchestration.com/2023/12/13/how-linkedin-is-moving-towards-a-skills-based-economy-with-the-skills-graph/">How LinkedIn is moving towards a skills-based economy with the Skills Graph</a> - 2024-01-22<span class="secondary"> - What is a skills-based economy and how is LinkedIn moving from vision to implementation?

At the end of 2022, actually as part of The Daily Stoic New Year New You Challenge (​new one starting on Jan 1 if you want to join us​), my wife and I picked a word we were going to use as our lodestar for the year. We picked ‘less’ because we felt like we were too busy, too overwhelmed, too stressed, too frustrated. I was just exhausted as December ended and I felt like my health, my family, and my quality of life could not face another year of the same. So as I wrote here, ​in an article​, my goal was: Less. Less commitments. Less drama. Less busyness. Less screen time. Just less. Part of the reason I want less is so I have room for more. More stillness. More presence. Looking back, I think we did a pretty good job. I was strict about passing on stuff I didn’t want to do. I asked my assistant not to schedule appointments or interviews or calls on Fridays. I pushed ​my book​ back a year—which required some serious negotiations with my publisher and facing a lot of ideas in myself about what it meant to not be so busy and always being doing, doing, doing. What did this ‘less’ translate to? Certainly not a lot of ‘nothing,’ which is what I think we suspect we’ll turn into if we start saying that powerful word ‘no’ or if we start slowing down. Instead, what happened is that I did a lot more. I did more school lunches and school drop offs. We went on more trips together. My wife and I hung out more. I spent more time on the book that I delayed, and now it’s much, much better. Now, staring down the barrel of a new year, I intend to continue this trend of less (to get the double benefit, as Marcus Aurelius writes in ​Meditations​, of doing the essential things better). But I also wanted to pick a new word to aim at. This year, the word for me is: Systems. In ​Ego Is The Enemy​, I tell the story of the day of Dwight D. Eisenhower’s inauguration. In 1953, Eisenhower was entering the White House as the newly inaugurated president, having just returned from his parade. As he walked into the Executive Mansion, his chief usher handed Eisenhower two letters marked “Confidential and Secret” that had been sent to him earlier in the day. “Never bring me a sealed envelope,” Eisenhower said firmly. “That’s what I have a staff for.” He wasn’t a snob nor was he being lazy. Eisenhower was a man who lived by systems. He saw the need for an efficient, orderly executive branch, mirroring the way his military units had been. His focus was on delegating, trusting his staff, and maintaining order. As his chief of staff later put it, “The president does the most important things. I do the next most important things.” A system is a way to do more by doing less. By setting up processes—which can be work up front—you find efficiencies. By setting up clear and defined roles, you can effectively delegate. By setting up standards and expectations, you can not only hold people accountable, but you can measure and optimize those processes to be even more efficient. It’s a positive feedback loop. What’s an example of a good system? I’ve talked about ​my notecard system​ before, that’s a system by which I research and write my books. I don’t just wing it. It’s a process by which I—and other writers—try to take an enormous and overwhelming task and try to make it manageable. As Robert Greene, who taught me the notecard system, says, “A lot of books fail because the writer loses control of the research. You are either a master of the material or it’s the master of you.” Sometimes a system is something like that—a process. Other times, systems are a person or a group of people, like Eisenhower was referring to with his staff. “A system,” as Donella Meadows defines it in ​Thinking in Systems​, “is a set of related components that work together in a particular environment to perform whatever functions are required to achieve the system’s objective.” A to do list is a system. A chain of command is a system. A rule that says “I never say ‘yes’ in the room” is a system for making better decisions. In fact, there was another insight from Eisenhower called the Eisenhower Decision Matrix that he would use to prioritize stuff. To separate and distinguish immediate tasks from important ones, Eisenhower would group tasks into a 2×2 matrix: urgent and important (quadrant I), important but not urgent (quadrant II), urgent but not important (quadrant III), and not important and not urgent (quadrant IV). It is a system for channeling focus onto tasks that are truly important and contribute to your long-term goals, rather than just reacting to what seems urgent at the moment. Contrasting with Eisenhower, in ​Ego Is The Enemy​, I also tell the story of John DeLorean, whose management style was once described as “chasing colored balloons.” Coming out of the bureaucratic management style of General Motors, DeLorean tried to make himself the center of everything. The result was chaos—chaos that both fueled his ego (somebody always needed him) and destroyed what was actually a pretty visionary car company. Few of us are that bad, but we could all do better with better systems. Because it’s really easy, when you don’t have a system, to get caught up just winging it–handling whatever is urgent, whatever someone has randomly brought you, or whatever pops up in your email or whatever you feel like doing in the moment. One of the reasons I am deciding to focus on systems this year is that it’s unavoidable. For a long time, I kept my life and my business deliberately very small.
